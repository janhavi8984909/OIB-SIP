# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project aims to **predict the quality of wine** using its **chemical characteristics** through **Machine Learning classification models**.  
The project demonstrates how data-driven insights can be applied to viticulture — analyzing the relationship between physicochemical properties (like acidity, density, and alcohol content) and perceived wine quality.

The dataset consists of multiple **chemical test results** for red and white wines, and the target variable (`quality`) represents a score between **0 and 10**, based on sensory evaluations.

## 📊 Dataset Description

**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository — *Wine Quality Dataset*  
**Link:** [Wine Quality Dataset - UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

The dataset contains **4,898 white wine samples** and **1,599 red wine samples**.  
Each sample is described by 11 physicochemical attributes and one sensory score (quality).

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `fixed acidity` | Non-volatile acids in wine (tartaric acid, etc.) |
| `volatile acidity` | Amount of acetic acid (vinegar-like smell) |
| `citric acid` | Adds freshness and flavor to wine |
| `residual sugar` | Remaining sugar after fermentation |
| `chlorides` | Amount of salt content |
| `free sulfur dioxide` | SO₂ in free form, helps prevent microbial growth |
| `total sulfur dioxide` | Total SO₂ concentration (free + bound) |
| `density` | Mass per unit volume; related to sugar/alcohol content |
| `pH` | Acidity level of the wine |
| `sulphates` | Contribute to wine preservation and flavor |
| `alcohol` | Alcohol content by volume |
| `quality` | Sensory rating (integer between 0 and 10) |

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized **correlation heatmaps** to identify key influencing features.  
- Observed that **alcohol**, **volatile acidity**, and **sulphates** had the strongest correlations with wine quality.  
- Checked for **missing values**, **outliers**, and **feature distributions**.  
- Applied **scaling and normalization** for model consistency.

## ⚙️ Model Training & Evaluation

Three models were implemented:

| Model | Accuracy (approx.) | Key Insights |
|--------|--------------------|---------------|
| **Random Forest Classifier** | 83.2% | High performance with balanced precision and recall |
| **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)** | 81.7% | Performs well after feature scaling |
| **SGD Classifier** | 78.4% | Fast training, suitable for large datasets |

*Metrics used:*  
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve (for model comparison)

## 📈 Key Insights

- Wines with **higher alcohol** and **moderate acidity** tend to score better.  
- Excessive **volatile acidity** negatively affects quality.  
- Ensemble methods (like Random Forest) outperform linear models for this dataset.  
- Feature scaling significantly improves the performance of SVC and SGD models.
