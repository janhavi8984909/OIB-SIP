# 🧠 Autocomplete and Autocorrect Data Analytics  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project explores and enhances the **efficiency and accuracy** of **autocomplete** and **autocorrect** algorithms using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
By analyzing large-scale text datasets, we evaluate multiple models to improve real-time **text prediction** and **error correction** — essential features in search engines, messaging apps, and assistive technologies.  

Unlike earlier versions that focused on algorithm implementation, this project integrates **data analytics**, **model benchmarking**, and **user experience evaluation**, offering a more comprehensive and data-driven perspective.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build an analytical framework for understanding and optimizing autocomplete and autocorrect systems.  
- Train models on diverse text datasets for improved **accuracy**, **response time**, and **context awareness**.  
- Generate interactive visualizations to represent performance trends, correction accuracy, and user feedback.
