# NYC Airbnb Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Project Idea
Cleaning Data

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and exploring the **New York City Airbnb dataset (2019)**. 
The dataset includes Airbnb listings across NYC, providing insights into hosts, locations, pricing, and review patterns.  
The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis, identify trends, and explore patterns in host activity and guest behavior.

## Dataset Description

- **Year:** 2019  
- **Location:** New York City, NY, USA  
- **Entries:** ~49,500 listings  
- **Features:** Listing IDs, host information, neighborhood, property type, price, reviews, availability, and ratings  

## Key Questions
- Which areas have the highest concentration of listings?  
- How do prices vary across neighborhoods and property types?  
- Who are the busiest hosts and what factors contribute to their activity?  
- Can we predict booking patterns based on location and property characteristics?

## Project Goals
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing and inconsistent values  
   - Standardize numeric and categorical columns  
   - Convert dates and categorical data to suitable formats  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summary statistics of price, availability, and review scores  
   - Distribution of listings across neighborhoods and property types  
   - Identify outliers and anomalies  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Calculate metrics such as `Average_Review_Score`, `Booking_Frequency`, `Price_per_Night`  
   - Encode categorical variables for analysis  

4. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Create charts and plots to illustrate trends and patterns  
   - Identify the busiest hosts and neighborhoods  
   - Provide actionable insights for Airbnb operations
